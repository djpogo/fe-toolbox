## quick start

``` bash
$ npm ci
$ npm run dev
$ npm run build
```

## slow start

For more information about the motivation of this repository please read my [blog post](https://raoulkramer.de/vite-mpa-handlebars-sass).

## project structure

Entry point html-wise is the [`src/views/index.html`](src/views/index.html) file.
Entry point js-wise is the [`src/main.js`](src/main.js) file.
Entry point (s)css-wise is the [`src/style.scss`](src/style.scss) file.

### views

This repository follows vites mpa workflow. And even if we write components with handlebars, the view-files should end with `.html`.`

**`src/views/**/*.html`**

But we will use handlebars syntax within our views. I just wanted to stay as close as possible to the vites mpa style.

### components

Components should be written in the `src/components/**` folder, with every component in its own directory.

Components can/should be self-containing:

``` html
<!-- src/components/image/image.hbs -->
<picture class="picture">
    ...
</picture>
<script type="module" src="{{resolve-from-root 'components/image/image.js'}}"></script>
```

``` js
// src/components/image/image.js
import './image.scss';
```

``` scss
/* src/components/image/image.scss */
.picture {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: block;

    &__img {
        width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }
}
```

This way, every time a handlebar component is used, it will bring its own js and css to the party and vite will take care of this.

## static assets

Files and folders within the [`src/public/**`](src/public/) folder will be copied 1:1 in the `dist` folder.

## .utils?

This repository comes with 2 vite plugins written by me.

### pageRouter

During development, the pageRouter handles the mapping urls to the view files.

The second `pages` function provides a list of the views for the `rollupOptions.input` property when running `npm run build`.

### cleanupPath

`npm run build` always wanted to generate all view files under `dist/views`, so I write this plugin which moves the view-files to the root of the `dist` folder.
